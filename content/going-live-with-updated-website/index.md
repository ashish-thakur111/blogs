I'm excited to announce that my updated website is now live. I migrated the site from Gatsby to a Next.js stack to improve maintainability, performance, and developer experience.

Old site: https://ashish-thakur111.github.io

New site: https://ashthakur.in

Why I migrated

- Maintenance and ecosystem: Gatsby's ecosystem and plugin maintenance have slowed compared to earlier years. Many community plugins are less actively maintained, which added friction when keeping dependencies secure and up to date.
- Modern Next.js features: Next.js offers a versatile rendering model (SSG, SSR, ISR) and newer capabilities like server components and built-in routing that simplify building modern React sites.
- Performance and build times: For my use case, Next.js provides faster incremental builds and more predictable build performance on larger sites.
- Developer experience: Improved DX with first-party tooling (image optimization, analytics, edge functions) and tighter integration with deployment platforms like Vercel.

What changed

- The site codebase is now a Next.js app with pages and components optimized for SSR/SSG as appropriate.
- Content remains Markdown-based and lives under `content/` for easy editing and future migrations.
- RSS, category filtering, and slugs are preserved during the transition.

What to expect

- Faster deploys and quicker content updates.
- Better compatibility with modern hosting and edge runtimes.
- **New Content Topics:** I'll be covering a lot more technical content, specifically focusing on:
    - **Open Source Software (OSS):** Contributing to and managing open-source projects.
    - **Java Ecosystem:** Deep dives into modern Java, Spring Boot, and performance tuning.
    - **Cloud Native:** Kubernetes, microservices architecture, and serverless patterns.
    - **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** Integrating LLMs, building AI-powered applications, MCP, and MLOps.
- **Ongoing improvements:** I'll continue refining the site, improving accessibility, and adding more posts.
